##Exploits##
>_ An exploit is a program that takes advantage of a security flaw in an application or system

>_ Remote exploit: Are the exploits that you can run on an external machine that you don't have prior access to

>_ Local exploit: Are exploits that you can run only with access to the machine 

>_ Payload: A malicious code or program to control the hacked system remotely 

>_ Shellcode: A set of instructions that executes a command in target machine to take control of

>_ Server-side exploit is to gain access of a server. (the attackers act as a client)

>_ The client-side exploit is to gain access to a client's computer. (the target is the client)

Mestasploit Framework

>_ Exploits: Exploit modules are defined as modules that use payloads. 

>_ Payload: Payloads consist of code that runs remotely

>_ Auxiliary modules: Auxiliary modules include port scanners, fuzzers, sniffers, and more.

>_ Post modules: Important for post-exploitation and pivoting

>_ Encoders: Encoders ensure that payloads make it to their destination intact

>_ No operations (NOPs): Nops keep the payload sizes consistent across exploit attempts
